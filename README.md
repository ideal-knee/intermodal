Some docker images that make my life easier.  I run these using Docker for Mac.

`devbox` Usage
--------------

  1. Save your ssh public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on _the host_.

  2. `devbox/build` in one host shell to build image and start container.

  3. `devbox/run` in another host shell to ssh into the container.
